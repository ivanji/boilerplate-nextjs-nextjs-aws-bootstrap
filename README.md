# NextJS / Serverless /

A boilerplate for a full stack application using the following stack

## Frontend

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- React-Bootstrap - Only for Bootstrap Components as these are quite accessible
- Instead of relying on the full default bootstrap stylesheets, each individual bootstrap module is included as scss under `styles/bootraps-scss/` for maximum customisation (removing any unnecessary modules). i.e. I rather use CSS grid to set up my own grids)

## Backend

- NodeJS
- Serverless (AWS Lambda)

### Services

`services/` folder contains individual services, created using a serverlesss.yml
